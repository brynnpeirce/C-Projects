<h1>C# Projects</h1>

<p>These are some small projects I made using c# and .NET Framework</p>

<h2>Projects</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Car Insurance </li>
 </ul>
 
 <h3>Car Insurance</h3>
 <p>This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes the user's input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.</p>
