<p>These are some small projects I made using c# and .NET Framework</p>

<h2>Projects</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Car Insurance </li>
    <li> Black Jack Gmae </li>
 </ul>
 
 <h3>Car Insurance</h3>
 <p>This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes the user's input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.</p>
 
  <h3>Black Jack Game (TwentyOne2) </h3>
 <p>This concole application uses C# that takes the user to a Casino Black Jack Game. The uses information is stored and can be displayed in another file for tracking and their score and bank are kept track of throughout their time playing</p>
